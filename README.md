* Object oriented programming with Python
* Test Driven Development
* Web Programming (REST, MVC)
* Interacting with a PostgreSQL database (CRUD)

## Rules

The project is built using only:

* HTML / CSS
* Python
* Flask
* PostgreSQL and the psycopg

It must **NOT** use:

* Any Object Relational Mapper (e.g. ActiveRecord)
* JavaScript. At all. Don't even think about it.
* Any pre-built CSS libraries, such as Bootstrap.
* Authentication. Assume that the user already has secure access to the app.

## Brief

A local gym has asked you to build a piece of software to help them to manage memberships, and register members for classes.

#### MVP

- The app allows the gym to create and edit Members
- The app allows the gym to create and edit Classes
- The app allows the gym to book members on specific classes
- The app shows a list of all upcoming classes
- The app shows all members that are booked in for a particular class

#### Additions

- The app shows all classes that a member is booked in for
- Classes are organised by date & time
- Classes have a maximum capacity and users can only be added while there is space remaining.
- Space remaining is displayed next to a class
- Members and classes can be set as active/deactivated. Deactivated members/classes do not appear when creating bookings.
- Classes past todays date do not appear when creating bookings


#### Future Extensions

- Membership type means Standard members can only be signed up for classes during off-peak hours. Premium members have access to premium classes
- Filter and display active/inactive members and classes
- Add ability to toggle the status of a user when viewing
